# ThePantryPuzzle
<!-- Our Project Idea: Our project idea mainly focuses on recommending and finding different recipes for the user as they enter the ingredients they have. Users can be divided into 2 categories: chef (recipes provider), and customer (the one searching for the recipes). Chefs can add whatever recipes they want and gain insights about how well a recipe is from the customer trials. In addition to adding ingredients and recipe searching, customers can provide reviews and ratings for each recipe. Moreover, customers can share the results of each recipe with the community. -->
